profiler
========

What is this?
-------------

Responsive template for profiling individuals. We used this several times, but the first iteration was built on deadline the day of the mass shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Netwon, Connecticut.

The project contains the following folders and important files:

1. Make a copy of this Google doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AurS2EUbrPERdE9Nc1dMSGdfenFCN0FCTk9jZF9TVWc&usp=sharing

3. In the Publish window, you'll find a URL that will contain a key. Copy that and paste into line 28 of index.html
